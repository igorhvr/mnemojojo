MnemoGoGo and MnemoJoJo 0.9.5 are released!

MnemoGoGo is a plugin for Mnemosyne. MnemoJoJo is a J2ME Midlet. Together
they allow you to review Mnemosyne cards on Java-enabled mobile phones.

!IMPORTANT!
The export format has changed. Put MnemoGoGo into local mode before
upgrading. Upgrade both MnemoGoGo and MnemoJoJo simulataneously.

Features and Fixes
------------------
This release contains several major improvements:

* Support for touchscreen phones.
  There are now optional onscreen buttons for showing the answer and grading
  cards.

* Card text is exported into a single file.
  This means that synchronization to phones and sdcards is faster, and that
  there are far fewer security prompts on older phones. This approach
  requires more memory at runtime, but a `cards to load ahead' option allows
  trade-offs to be made.

* All exported filenames are in uppercase.
  This works around a problem for some Windows drivers that capitalize
  8.3 filenames during synchronization to phones.

* Configurable font sizes.

* Configurable grading keys.
  On some phones, like the Nokia E61, the number keys are only accessible
  after pushing a `shift key'. The grading keys can now be customised to
  avoid this annoyance.

* Various small bugs fixed.
  - Different timezones are now properly handled.
  - Problems in statistics logging are now fixed.
  - The lack of the Python Imaging Library is treated more gracefully.
  - Restricting images to a maximum size now works properly.

Phone Status
------------
I have been using MnemoGoGo/MnemoJoJo to review my own cards for several
months and I now consider it reliable enough to recommend for general use.
This version should be considered a beta release for experienced computer
users.

Several phones are known to work:
 * Nokia 6121
 * Nokia E61
 * Nokia N95
 * Nokia 5800 (Express Music) 

Some phones may work (confirmation needed):
 * Samsung G600

Phones with problems (experienced help needed):
 * Blackberry 8320

Thanks to everyone who reported issues. Please let me know if MnemoJoJo
works on your phone if it is not listed above.

Release Schedule
----------------
Tasks required before 1.0 release:
- Improve online documentation.
- Add instructions for installing Python Imaging Library under Windows.
  (needed to resize images for display on phones.)
- Integrate small patch into Mnemosyne official release.

Future work (not scheduled for 1.0 release, any help accepted!)
- Multithreading
- Localization
- Sounds

Source code and licensing
-------------------------
MnemoGoGo and MnemoJoJo are provided free of charge and without any warranty
or guarantees.

The MnemoGoGo (plugin and database) source code contains algorithms ported
from Peter Bienstman's Mnemosyne. It is released under the GPL version 2.

The MnemoJoJo (user interface) source code will be made available under a
BSD license soon. It uses a patched version of Pashalis Padeleris' Fire UI
library.
